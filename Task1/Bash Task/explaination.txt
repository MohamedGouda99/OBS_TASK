Define user data:

An array called users is defined. Each element of this array is a string containing user information in the format: "Name, Email, ID". For example, "John, john_j123@domain.com, 325".
Create input file (input.txt):

The script loops through the users array and appends each user's information to a file named input.txt with a new line character.
Process input:

The script then reads each line from input.txt and separates the values (name, email, and id) using the , delimiter.

It uses sed to remove leading and trailing spaces from each field (name, email, and id).

It checks if both the id and email are not empty (-n checks for non-empty strings).

If both id and email are not empty, it proceeds to do the following:

It uses awk to determine if the id is even or odd and assigns the result to id_type.
It checks if the email matches a regular expression pattern that resembles a valid email address.
Depending on the conditions, it prints different messages:

If both id and email are valid, it prints a message stating the ID type.
If the email is not valid, it prints a message indicating that the email is invalid.
If either the id or email is empty, it prints a message saying there are invalid parameters.
