It imports the re module, which provides support for regular expressions.

It defines two functions:

is_valid_email(email): This function checks if the provided email matches a specific pattern that resembles a valid email address. It uses a regular expression pattern to perform this check.

process_user_data(name, email, id): This function takes three arguments (name, email, and id). It performs the following operations:

Removes leading and trailing spaces from name, email, and id.
Tries to convert id to an integer. If successful, it determines whether the integer is even or odd.
If a ValueError occurs during the conversion (i.e., if id cannot be converted to an integer), it sets id_type to None.
It defines a list called users containing tuples. Each tuple represents user data with three elements: name, email, and id.

It opens a file named "input.txt" in write mode ("w") and writes the formatted user data to it. Each line contains the name, email, and id separated by commas.

It then opens the "input.txt" file in read mode ("r") and iterates through each line.

For each line, it does the following:

It strips any leading or trailing spaces and splits the line into name, email, and id using commas.

It calls the process_user_data function to clean and process the user data.

It checks if id_type is not None and if the email is valid using the is_valid_email function.

Depending on the conditions, it prints different messages. Specifically:

If id_type is not None and the email is valid, it prints a message stating the ID type and email.
If id_type is None, it prints a message stating that the ID is invalid for the given name.
If the email is not valid, it prints a message stating that the email is invalid for the given name.
